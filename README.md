To recreate the cluster results from the KMeansModel, place the provided preprocessed CSV file (`task_02_preprocessed.csv`) in the project directory and load it into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the preprocessed dataset
df = pd.read_csv("task_02_preprocessed.csv")
```

Then, run the necessary code snippet related to the specific model training part after installing the required libraries in your environment.
